ASKGRADE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (LICENSE.TXT)

Version 1.0 — Last updated: August 17, 2025

IMPORTANT: READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE. By installing, accessing, or using AskGrade (the “Software”) or the hosted AskGrade service (the “Service”), you agree to be bound by the terms of this License Agreement (the “Agreement”). If you do not agree, do not install, access, or use the Software or Service.

1. DEFINITIONS 1.1 “Licensor” means the owner of AskGrade and all associated intellectual property. 1.2 “You” or “Licensee” means the individual or legal entity exercising rights under this Agreement. 1.3 “Software” means the AskGrade codebase, in whole or in part, including updates made available by Licensor. 1.4 “Service” means the hosted/SaaS offering of AskGrade operated by Licensor. 1.5 “Authorized Users” means your employees, contractors, or students you authorize to access the Software or Service under your account.


2. GRANT OF LICENSE (SELF-HOSTED SOFTWARE) Subject to payment of applicable fees (if any) and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to: (a) install and run one (1) production instance of the Software for your internal use; and (b) create reasonable non-production instances for development and testing.


3. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE (SAAS) If you subscribe to the Service, Licensor will provision access to the Service for your Authorized Users in accordance with your plan. Your access is a subscription, not a sale of the Software. Licensor may update the Service from time to time.


4. RESTRICTIONS You shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) copy the Software except as expressly permitted in Section 2; (b) modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Software, except to the extent expressly allowed by Licensor in writing; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law; (d) rent, lease, sell, sublicense, distribute, or make the Software or Service available to any third party, including as part of a managed service or to build a competing product or service; (e) remove or alter proprietary notices; or (f) use the Software or Service in violation of applicable laws or for high-risk activities where failure could lead to death or personal injury.


5. OWNERSHIP The Software and Service are licensed, not sold. Licensor and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and Service.


6. FEEDBACK Feedback is voluntary. If you provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas, you grant Licensor a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate that feedback without restriction.


7. DATA; PRIVACY Use of the Service may involve processing personal data. You are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining any required consents from your Authorized Users. Licensor will process data in accordance with its then-current Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum, where applicable.


8. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS The Software may include or depend on third-party components under separate licenses (including open-source). Those licenses govern the third-party components. A NOTICE file (if provided) lists such components.


9. SUPPORT; UPDATES Unless a separate support agreement applies, Licensor has no obligation to provide support or updates. Any updates provided are governed by this Agreement.


10. FEES AND TAXES Fees (if any) are as stated at purchase or in your order form. All fees are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for all applicable taxes, duties, and charges, excluding taxes based on Licensor’s net income.


11. TERM AND TERMINATION This Agreement is effective on your first use of the Software or Service and continues until terminated. Licensor may suspend or terminate your license or Service access if you breach this Agreement or fail to pay fees when due. Upon termination, you must stop using and destroy all copies of the Software in your possession, and your access to the Service will cease.


12. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.


14. INDEMNITY You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor from and against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to (a) your use of the Software or Service in violation of this Agreement or applicable law; (b) your content or data; or (c) any dispute between you and your Authorized Users.


15. EXPORT COMPLIANCE You must comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws. You represent that you are not located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any country or party subject to comprehensive sanctions.


16. GOVERNING LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION This Agreement is governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict-of-law rules. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute. If unresolved, disputes will be brought exclusively in the courts located in [Venue], and each party consents to personal jurisdiction there. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.


17. CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT Licensor may update this Agreement from time to time. For the Service, continued use after the effective date of an update constitutes acceptance. For self-hosted licenses, changes apply when you download or install an updated version or otherwise agree.


18. GENERAL If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect. You may not assign this Agreement without Licensor’s prior written consent; Licensor may assign it to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. No waiver is effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving party.
